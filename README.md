# NookDepo

This is a project to give a space for players of Animal Crossing New Horizons to have a online depository to be able to store and check what items that they have aquired and caught and to see what they are missing or looking to find! with goals of creating more tools to help assist players.

For this project we are using the ACNH API to easily query all information that the players need; that can be found here http://acnhapi.com/.
